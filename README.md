# CodeWars
Daily CodeWars Push to Github to follow my progress. I have been doing codewars several times a week since May, but have only recently started doing daily pushes to Github.

How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript and CodeWars.

Lessons Learned/ing:
Consistency is key. By solving daily coding challenges I am becoming more and more confident and effective at solving problems.
